# Swapping

Swapping is the process of exchanging one asset for another. It's a behavior similar to buying/selling or trading.

## How to swap assets

1. **Connect your wallet**.
   Before you can swap assets on Pando Proto, you need to connect the wallet.
2. **Choose the asset you want to swap and the asset you want to receive**
3. **Enter the amount**.
   Enter the amount of the asset you want to swap, and Pando will automatically calculate the amount of the other token.
4. **Review the details**.
   Before submitting the transaction, review the details of the swap, including the transaction fee and the price impact.
5. **Submit the transaction**.
   Once you've reviewed the details, confirm the transaction in your wallet.
6. **Wait for the transaction to be processed**
   The time it takes for the transaction to be processed depends on the network congestion and the transaction fee you've set. You can check the status of your transaction on the blockchain explorer.

That's it! You've successfully swapped tokens on Pando Proto.

::: warning
Please pay attention to the price effect when swapping.

When the price impact is too high, it means that the transaction is lack of liquidity or the transaction amount is too large, and continuing trading may cause greater losses.
