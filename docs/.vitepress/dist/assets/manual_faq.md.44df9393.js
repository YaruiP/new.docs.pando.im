You gain interest of the assets you supplied and there is no fee you need to pay.</p><p>In the very extreme situation though, as assets available to borrow on the market all come from users&#39; supply, if there are bad debts (meaning a loan that is not likely to be paid), there is a chance that you cannot get back the full amount of your supplied assets. However, it is unlikely to happen in Pando Rings as liquidation is monitored real-time by liquidating bots (algorithms to execute liquidation) to avoid bad debts from happening.</p><p>If you do have loans, when the value of your borrowed assets has exceeded your borrow limit, you will enter liquidation, losing part or all of your collateral (ie. pledged assets). Of your total supplied assets, the pledged assets are subject to liquidation while your unpledged assets will stay intact.</p><p>It is important tht you pay close attention to the loan risk indicator to monitor your loan risk, and keep your collateral safe from liquidation.</p><h2 id="will-there-be-any-loss-of-my-pledged-assets-in-leaf" tabindex="-1">Will there be any loss of my pledged assets in Leaf? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-there-be-any-loss-of-my-pledged-assets-in-leaf" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will there be any loss of my pledged assets in Leaf?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s possible. If your vault breaches the minimum required collateralization ratio, it will be liquidated and the collateral will be on auction, and your pledged assets will be sold to repay the loan.</p><h2 id="what-s-mtg" tabindex="-1">What&#39;s MTG? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-mtg" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What&#39;s MTG?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>MTG is the short name of &quot;Mixin Trusted Group&quot;, which is a kind of framework based on Mixin Network&#39;s multi-signature feature.

Concensus has to be reached among the nodes to perform certain administrative actions.
