# FAQ

## Where can I see liquidity mining earnings?

The liquidity mining earnings are shown in the "Earn" page.

If you've provided liquidity to a pool, please go to the "Earn" page to see your earnings.

## How to get the earnings out?

The earnings are in the form of LP tokens. You can remove liquidity to get the underlying assets. 

If you get profits from the underlying assets, you can sell them to get PND.

## How are prices determined?

Every transaction on Pando's trade function will have an impact on the price.

If the total amount of the liquidity pool is large, the transaction amount is negligible relative to the depth of the liquidity pool, and this transaction will have a very low price impact, which called slippage.

When the impact reaches a certain level, the price on 4swap is different from the prices on other exchanges, which will form an arbitrage space. There are many automatic arbitrage robots working hard all the time to ensure consistent prices.

::: warning
It is important to pay attention to the size of the transaction amount relative to the total amount of liquidity. If the transaction amount is too high relative to the total amount of the liquidity pool, the transaction price will seriously deviate from the market price, resulting in greater losses.
