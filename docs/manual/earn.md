Some booths are provided by Pando Proto, some are provided by third party developers. Please be aware that Pando Proto does not guarantee the security of third party booths.

## Liquidity Mining

Liquidity mining is a way to earn crypto assets by providing liquidity to a trading pair of Pando Proto. For example, if you provide liquidity to the trading pair of BTC/USDT, you will earn BTC and USDT as rewards. 

The rewards come from the trading fees of the trading pair. They are distributed to liquidity providers in proportion to their contribution to the liquidity pool. The more liquidity you provide, the more transactions occur in the pool, the more rewards you will earn.

Rewards are not distributed by separate transactions. Instead, they will add value to the LP tokens you hold. You can claim your rewards by removing liquidity from the pool.

::: info
The liquidity mining may loss because of the impermanent loss. Please read [this section](https://docs.pando.im/manual/trade.html#impermanent-loss) to learn more about impermanent loss.

Each liquidity pool has two indicators to describe the rate of return of this pool, namely `pUSD AROR` and `Base AROR`.

in which,

- `Base AROR` refers to the 30-day approximate annualized rate of return of the two basic tokens in the liquidity pool by converting the profit and loss into the liquidity pool. It can be roughly understood as converting the income into the currency-based 30-day approximate annualized rate of return of coin in the liquidity pool.
